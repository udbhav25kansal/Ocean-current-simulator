## 🔬 The Science

This simulator demonstrates:

**Research Question**: What drives ocean currents in the Strait of Georgia?

**Three Forces**:
1. **River Discharge** (Fraser River outflow)
2. **Wind** (surface stress)
3. **Tides** (semi-diurnal oscillations)

**Key Findings**:
- Winter: Wind dominates
- Summer: River dominates
- Tides: Always present

**Approach**: AI/ML clustering model learns from real data (HF radar, buoys, river gauges)

---

## 📊 Performance

**Expected**:
- 50-60 FPS on modern hardware
- <2 second load time
- Smooth particle motion
- Responsive controls

**If slower**:
- Reduce particle count
- Disable vector arrows
- Close other tabs
- See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

---

## 🚧 Common Issues

### Blank screen
→ Check console (F12), see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### Controls not working
→ Refresh page, check welcome screen closed

### Particles not moving
→ Increase wind/river/tide parameters

### Low FPS
→ Reduce particle count in controls

---

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Day 1**: Run simulator, try presets, explore controls
**Day 2**: Read README.md for research context
**Day 3**: Experiment with parameters, understand physics
**Day 4**: Read DEVELOPMENT.md to understand code
**Day 5**: Customize and extend!

---

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server (port 3000)

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Test production build

# Maintenance
npm install          # Install/update dependencies
```
